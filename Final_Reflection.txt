This project provided hands-on experience with the end-to-end data lifecycle across three platforms. In MySQL, I worked with a relational database, exploring tables, relationships, and SQL queries for transactional data. In Snowflake, I learned how to create a cloud data warehouse, design a star schema, and perform analytical queries efficiently for business insights. MongoDB allowed me to model the same data as flexible JSON documents and run aggregation queries without joins. Comparing the three, MySQL is ideal for OLTP operations, Snowflake excels in OLAP and analytical workloads, and MongoDB provides schema flexibility for semi-structured or rapidly evolving data. This exercise gave me a strong understanding of how data flows across different architectures and how to choose the right tool for each use case.
